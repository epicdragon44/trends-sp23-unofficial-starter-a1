# Simple A1 Setup

This a simple setup to help you test and implement A1, should you need it.

I've simply copied the boiler-plate code we provided you, and then added two
libraries to help you get started:

-   Jest, a testing framework so you can unit test each function.
-   TypeScript, for native TS support so that you don't have to compile everything you do down to JS first.

## Commands to get started

Set-Up:

-   `npm install` - Install all dependencies

Test:

-   `npm test` - Run all tests

Run:

-   `npm run build` - Build the project (compile TS to JS)
-   `npm start` - Run the project (run the compiled JS)

## Files to edit

-   `src/index.ts` - This is where you'll write your code! This is the only relevant file you'll be submitting to us.
-   `src/index.test.ts` - This is where you'll write your tests! We're not going to provide tests ourselves -- it's up to you to make sure your function works!
